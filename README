1. Description: 
   script use to run packmem, a python package that quantifies the 
   hydrophobic defects of a lipid bilayer. The number of hydrophobic 
   defects could be a contributer to passive lipid transport. 
   One could imagine that a sizeable defect could create positive 
   electrostatic interactions between a lipid and the defect. 
   that being said these defects are typically short lived. 

2. Instruction 
   To use the script one must have download packmem, and define 
   the appropriate paths, where packmem is stored, where you have 
   your trajectories. Look up packmems documentation for further detail 
   on its use.
